# Product Analysis of Sales Data in an E-Commerce Company

## Introduction
Our web company operates across a few industries, including e-commerce, and it is crucial to understand how long it takes for customers to make a purchase on our website, to investigate the efficiency of our website, enhance its performance, as well as identify areas for improvement.

## Requirements 
- To identify how long it takes for a customer to purchase on our website: to measure a user’s duration from first arriving on the website on any given day until their first purchase on that same day.
- The final result should show the daily duration dynamic.
- To look for interesting data points that can give more insights to the analysis.

## Questions to be answered with the analysis
1. What is the duration of a customer journey from the first arrival on our website to the first purchase on any given day?
2. What is the relationship between the duration until the first purchase and the sales revenue (do customers who spend more time on the website generate more revenue for the company)?
3. Are there any factors that affect this duration (*recurring purchases, *sales campaigns, *seasonality, *countries of customer origin, *browsers used to access our website, etc.)? 
The analysis aims to answer these questions to allow for a better understanding of our customer base, their preferences and behaviour, and enable us to drive sales revenue, streamline resources, and provide better customer experience.
